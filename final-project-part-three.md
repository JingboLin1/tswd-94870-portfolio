# The final data story
> Include a link to your final data story on Shorthand, Esri StoryMaps, etc. here. 

In Part 3, I want to help new students coming to CMU quickly figure out which neighborhoods are actually worth looking at. Instead of throwing random rental numbers at them, I focus on two things they care about the most in real life: how long the commute is and how much the rent costs. In this section, I pull together several popular areas where CMU students often live and summarize, for each one, the average monthly rent (mainly for studios) and the typical commute time to campus (mostly by bus, with walking or biking mentioned when it makes sense). By putting all of this in one clear view, the goal is to save readers from bouncing between different websites and doing their own mental math. Ideally, they can glance at the chart and quickly see which neighborhoods are both within their budget and won’t make the daily trip to CMU too exhausting, giving them a solid starting point for their housing search.

# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

Compared with Part 2, I made two main changes in this section. First, I reshaped the overall structure. Instead of just listing all the neighborhoods in one place, I grouped the areas around campus into three “rings” based on commute time: Ring 1 covers neighborhoods close enough that you can walk or get to CMU with a very short bus ride; Ring 2 is roughly a 15–30 minute commute; and Ring 3 includes outer areas where the commute is longer but the rent is usually cheaper. On top of that, I created a separate bar graph for each ring and a choropleth map that plots these neighborhoods on a map, using different colors or color intensity to show rent levels so readers can quickly see which ring is generally more expensive. The bar graphs are used to compare average rent within the same ring, and a scatter plot of commute time versus average rent makes the trade-off between “time” and “money” much easier to see.

The second change is about how I present the information. In Part 2, I only had a table with neighborhood names and their average rent. All the data was there, but readers had to go through it line by line and do their own comparisons, which is tiring and not very intuitive. After getting feedback from classmates, I realized that a table by itself doesn’t really help people make housing decisions. So in Part 3, I turned those text-and-number lists into visualizations and used bar graphs to show rent levels across different neighborhoods. Instead of staring at numbers to figure out which one is higher, readers can follow the height of the bars, quickly see which areas are more expensive and which are more affordable, and then layer commute time on top of that to make a clearer choice.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

This project is mainly for new CMU students who are trying to find a place to live but don’t really know Pittsburgh yet. They’re usually busy dealing with visas, classes, and paperwork, so they don’t have the time or energy to compare ten different tabs of maps and rental sites. What they really want to know is simple: where can I live that I can afford, and how long will it take me to get to campus every day? The ring idea (Ring 1–3), the choropleth map, and the bar and scatter plots are all there to answer exactly that. The goal is to let them glance at the visuals, quickly see which neighborhoods fit their budget and commute comfort zone, and then pick a few areas to seriously start apartment hunting in.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section.
