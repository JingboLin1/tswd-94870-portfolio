# Can Students Afford to Live Near CMU Campus?
## A Data Story of Rent and Commute Trade-offs
In Part I, I framed this project around a familiar question for CMU students: can you realistically afford to live near campus, and what are you giving up if you move farther away? Students are paying in two currencies at the same time – monthly rent and minutes spent commuting – and both affect daily life.

For Part II, I am keeping the same core question but making the story more concrete and focused. Instead of talking about “near” and “far” in a vague way, I will use clear distance bands around CMU and tie them to neighborhoods that students actually talk about: North/Central/South Oakland, Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, Bloomfield, and a few other nearby areas that appear often in housing conversations.

The main goal is to help new and future CMU students see how different combinations of rent and commute time play out across these areas. By the end of the story, a reader should be able to answer simple, practical questions such as:

- If I pay more to live within walking distance, how much time am I really saving each day?

- If I move one “ring” farther out, how much might I save on rent, and what kind of commute am I signing up for?

Are there “sweet spots” where rent is not the lowest but the overall trade-off still feels reasonable?

The project is not meant to tell everyone to live in the same place. It is meant to make those trade-offs visible and concrete, instead of relying only on anecdotes like “Oakland is too expensive” or “that neighborhood is way too far on the bus.”

# User research 

## Target audience
My primary audience is new students at CMU (undergraduate, master’s, and PhD). They are ready to begin their new academic journey at CMU but don’t know much about rental housing in Pittsburgh. My main goal is to help them understand the local housing options and choose the neighborhood that suits them best, so they can find an apartment that fits their budget. 

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

- When you decided to come to CMU, what factors did you consider when choosing where to live?
- Are you satisfied with your current way of commuting?
- How many times a day do you travel to and from CMU?
- What is your primary mode of transportation?
- Which area/neighborhood do you live in?
- What is your approximate commuting time each day?
- What is your main mode of commuting?

## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

- Many students choose their apartments based only on the rent price, without first considering the impact of transportation.
- 60% of the respondents are dissatisfied with their current commute from their apartment to CMU, and said that if they could, they would choose differently.
- 80% the respondents commute by bus, with a few choosing to walk, skateboard, or bike. However, they all said that commuting in winter is very troublesome for them.

# Moodboards / personas
The Budget-First Student

- “I just need something affordable. I can handle a longer commute.”

- You’re okay with 25–35 minutes on the bus each way.

- You care more about lowering your monthly rent than about rolling out of bed and walking to class.

- You might look more seriously at Ring 3 areas, or the cheaper corners of Ring 2, if they feel safe and convenient enough.

The Commute-First Student

- “My time and energy are limited. I want to be close, even if it costs more.”

- You’d rather pay extra than spend an hour every day on buses.

- You care about being able to stay late on campus, go home between classes, or walk back after an event.

- You might focus on Ring 1 and the closest parts of Ring 2, where walking is realistic or the bus ride is very short.

The Balanced Trade-Off Student

- “I don’t need the cheapest or the closest option. I want something in the middle.”

- You are willing to pay a bit more than the cheapest option to avoid the very longest commutes.

- A 20–25 minute trip feels acceptable if the rent is reasonable and the neighborhood fits your lifestyle.

- You might explore Ring 2 more deeply, looking for places that sit in that “middle” cluster on the scatterplot.
