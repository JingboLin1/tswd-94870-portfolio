#Final Project Part I – JingBo Lin
##Can Students Afford to Live Near CMU Campus?
###A Data Story of Rent and Commute Trade-offs

#1. Project Overview
> Finding a place to live is one of the first big stressors for many CMU students, especially for people who just moved to Pittsburgh and don’t really know the neighborhoods yet. You quickly hear that living near campus in areas like Oakland, Squirrel Hill, or Shadyside is “too expensive,” but choosing a cheaper place farther away usually means more time on the bus, less sleep, and less flexibility in your daily schedule. In reality, students are not just paying rent in dollars — they are also paying in time and energy.

In this project, I want to look more closely at the trade-off between rent and commute time for areas around CMU. I plan to compare neighborhoods that are within walking distance to those that are farther out but still popular among students. Using publicly available data on typical rents and commute times, I’ll build a set of visualizations that show how different housing choices affect both a student’s budget and their daily routine. The goal is not to say “everyone should live here,” but to give current and future students a clearer picture of what they gain or give up when they decide to live closer or farther from campus.

# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
Text here...

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
