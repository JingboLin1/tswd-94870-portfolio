# Dog Bites in New York City


_For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance.  This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._

## Step one: the visualization
<img src="DOG-BITES-NYC-RAW.webp" width="700"/>
_Include link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization.  For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source._

## Step two: the critique

<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1763082562955');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';

_First, I downloaded the New York City ZIP codes from the web and joined that file with the dog-bites dataset, so the map only shows New York City. This helps keep the viewer’s attention on NYC instead of being distracted by other areas. Then I used a blue color gradient, from dark to light, to highlight which parts of the city have more frequent dog-bite incidents._

<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1763083058954');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>
_Next, I created a line graph over time to show when dog bite incidents occurred by month. We can see that the frequency of bites peaks between June and August, which suggests that summer is the high-risk season for these incidents._

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution
<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1763082158728' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Bo&#47;Book2_17630655931910&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Book2_17630655931910&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Bo&#47;Book2_17630655931910&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='zh-CN' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                

<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1763082158728');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  vizElement.style.width='1300px';vizElement.style.height='758px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
  vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

_Here is my final design. This final dashboard has several strengths. First, it brings all the key views onto a single screen, so readers can quickly see when, where, and which kinds of dogs are involved in bite incidents without jumping between multiple charts. The layout follows a natural flow: the total number of bites and trend in the top left provide overall context; the heatmap in the center answers when bites occur; the map on the right shows where they happen; and the charts at the bottom and left explain who the dogs are in terms of gender, age, and whether they are fixed. At the same time, they can click on the charts labeled “Click to Filter.” For example, if a reader is interested in the data for January 2017, they can find the January 2017 cell in the heatmap and click it; then every chart will update to show only the data for January 2017, including where the incidents occurred, the ages of the dogs, the % of dogs not fixed, the total number of bites, and the dogs’ genders._
